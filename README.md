# SIEBENUHR

### A museum-quality modern take on the classic 7-segment clock, enlarged to ridiculous proportions.

### Made from high quality materials, the gorgeous color provided by the latest in professional color-balanced LED illumination. 

###  More than just a clock, SEIBENUHR becomes a centerpiece for your home, providing feedback through color and animation. It’s able to react to motion, daytime, the weather and can even integrate seamlessly with Home Assistant to provide alarms and visual notifications.

## Notes

When developing the library and the firmware at the same time, the lib_dependency needs to be updated manually with:

```cmd
pio lib update
```
